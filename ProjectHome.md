The HUD started out as Omp HUD but then I made slight modifications to the positioning, colour and size of certain elements as well as the font for some of the features.

My HUD is pretty much Omp's HUD but you will notice some differences. Please go check out his FULL HUD here: http://rawr.am/tf2hud/

In previous versions of my HUD, I used a modified version of KBN HUD but I have since moved on to Omp's because I liked everything about it besides the colours.

I moved the numbers for the health, ammo and damage counter a little as well as some colours. The Health Cross was re-added and resized. I changed the default colours of the health/ammo as well as changed the animations for low-ammo and low-hp.
